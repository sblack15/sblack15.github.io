[Multi-view Classification Using Hybrid Fusion and Mutual Distillation](/projects/multi-view-classification/) \\
Our novel approach adapts off-the-shelf hybrid CNN/Transformer networks to achieve state-of-the-art performance classifying unstructured (e.g., scene identification) and cross-view (e.g., chest X-ray diagnosis) image collections. \\
<small>Samuel Black and Richard Souvenir. In IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2024.</small>

[Visualizing Paired Image Similarity in Transformer Networks](/projects/transformer-visualization/) \\
We introduce novel approach for spatially decomposing the similarity between a pair of images encoded with an image Transformer. \\

[The 2021 Hotel-ID to Combat Human Trafficking Competition Dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05746.pdf) \\
We develop a new dataset and Kaggle [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/hotel-id-2021-fgvc8) for fine-grained hotel room image classification.
