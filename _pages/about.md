I am a Senior Data Scientist at Walmart Global Tech, where I work in researching and deploying computer vision solutions to support asset protection. Prior to joining Walmart, I recieved my Ph.D. at Temple University in the [Computer & Information Sciences Department](https://cis.temple.edu). I was a member of the [Vision, Imaging, and Data Analysis Research Lab](https://github.com/vidarlab) under the supervision of [Dr. Richard Souvenir](https://cis.temple.edu/~souvenir/). My graduate research focused on deep learning for large-scale, fine-grained image classification and retrieval, including contributions to [Traffickcam](https://traffickcam.com/about-us/), a platform that aids in identifying hotel rooms to combat human trafficking. This work has encompassed diverse areas, including optimizing multi-view search, improving the interpretability of search tools, and enabling robust handling of partially-censored queries.
