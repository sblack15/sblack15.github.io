I am Ph. D candidate at Temple University in the Computer & Information Sciences Department. I am a member of the [Vision, Imaging, and Data Analysis Research Lab](https://github.com/vidarlab) and advised by [Richard Souvenir](https://cis.temple.edu/~souvenir/). I study applied computer vision, with my dissertation focusing on methods for multi-view image classification/retrieval. 

Prior to starting at Temple, I graduated from Villanova University with an M.Sc. in Computer Science in 2018, and from Oberlin College with a B.A. in Economics in 2016.
