I am a Ph.D. candidate at Temple University in the Computer & Information Sciences Department. I am a member of the [Vision, Imaging, and Data Analysis Research Lab](https://github.com/vidarlab) and advised by [Richard Souvenir](https://cis.temple.edu/~souvenir/). My graduate research focuses on developing deep learning techniques to improve large-scale, fine-grained image classification and retrieval systems. This work has encompassed diverse areas, including optimizing multi-view search, improving the interpretability of search tools, and enabling robust handling of partially-censored queries, with research outputs integrated into production applications.

Prior to starting at Temple, I graduated from Villanova University with an M.Sc. in Computer Science in 2018, and from Oberlin College with a B.A. in Economics in 2016.
